# Introduction
This is a project that implemented activation of the simcard for customers.
Through this project, I learnt how to use rest controller to 
pass the request and reply the request in good condition.
Moreover, I learnt something about using JPA to CRUD the h2 database, which is more easily to 
use than writing SQL sentences, and some knowledge about the cucumber's testing function and 
the SonarQube's validation.

# Technique
1. Restful micro-service (Web)
2. JPA for h2 database
3. Cucumber for testing
4. SonarQube for checking the programming problems
